Virtual Simulated Clinician (VSC) – DSM-Integrated Documentation Engine Upgrade
Overview
This release of the Virtual Simulated Clinician (VSC) platform integrates DSM-5-TR specifier-driven diagnostic narratives directly into the automated documentation engine.
The build links diagnostic category selections to dynamic assessment generation, targeted intervention recommendations, and risk flagging logic — while preserving full homework library access.

This version also incorporates the Biometric Concordance trigger for high-risk intervention pathways.
For example, when a DSM selection matches a Borderline Personality Disorder specifier and the biometric concordance reading is “Low,” the system invokes an adaptive high-risk response loop to insert additional clinical risk management content into the note.

What’s New in This Release
DSM-Driven Narrative Injection – All DSM specifiers in the drop-down menu now feed directly into the session summary and Assessment section of the generated DAP note.

Biometric Concordance-Linked Escalation – Replaces the old Borderline Personality Disorder toggle button with a conditional trigger based on biometric concordance + DSM match.

Preserved Homework Library – Full set of 50 PDF-based homework assignments remains accessible from the interface.

Framework Retention – All original therapeutic framework options (CBT, DBT, MI, SFBT, etc.) remain operational and selectable alongside the DSM category list.
